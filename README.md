# Norman Ed Portfolio Website
_Built with React, Formik, EmailJS, and react-stack-grid_


## About
Artist and instructor Norman Ed was in need of a website. I included galleries to exhibit different periods of his artwork, pages to showcase his exhibitions and mentions in the press, a biography, contact form, and a randomized custom 404 page.
